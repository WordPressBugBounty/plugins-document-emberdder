It supports local file uploads as well as files hosted on platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox. Files are displayed using the Google Drive viewer and can be configured to match your layout.

The new Document Library module adds a powerful way to organize and display multiple documents in a structured library. You can upload files from your device, WordPress Media Library, or via URL, rename or delete documents easily, and display them with customizable layouts. The library includes search, filter, and sorting options, a responsive design, and full control over view and download buttons. Shortcode and Gutenberg block support make it easy to add libraries anywhere on your site.
